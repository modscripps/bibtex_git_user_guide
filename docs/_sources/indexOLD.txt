MOD Literature Repository User Guide
====================================

This guide explains how to use the group's literature repository together with BibDesk. BibDesk is a free mac program that is a front end for a bibtex .bib file.  It allows GUI-based manipulation of the database, easy importation of new references, and most importantly linking to a PDF of the article itself.

ssh key
=======

First you need to create an ssh key that will identify you on the server. That way you don't have to type a password every time you want to sync your repo with the server. Open up a terminal and go to your home directory

.. code-block:: unix

  cd ~

See if you have an ssh directory already:

.. code-block:: unix

    ls .ssh

If you don't have the directory yet (you will see something like ls: .ssh: No such file or directory) then create it:

.. code-block:: unix
  
  mkdir .ssh
  chmod 700 .shh

Now change into the ssh directory and take a look at what is there:

.. code-block:: unix

  cd .ssh
  ls

**Contents:**

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   main

.. * :ref:`search`
